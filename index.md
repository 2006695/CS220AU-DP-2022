# Data- The New Oil
Can the increased adoption of digital identities enable the control and manipulation of personal data by powerful actors, and contribute to an existential threat to human rights and free-will on a global scale

## Abstract
- It is almost impossible to function in the modern world without the use of the internet. This has led to the creation of large digital identities, through the use of different websites who track that use through digital surveillance. The amount of information now available online about an individual has been commodified by corporations who aim to use it to control and manipulate people. If it continues in the same way, this manipulation will lead to the removal of humanity’s free-will, posing an existential threat.

### 01-Introduction
- This essay sets out to critically investigate the relationship between the growing reliance of digital identities and the potential of it leading to an existential threat to humanity, by causing the destruction of a desirable future. The desirable future being referred to throughout this essay is one in which humans have free will to make their own choices and decide their own future. This future is put at risk by the practice of data surveillance which has led to a surveillance based economy, where consumer information is the commodity that must be given in order to access the internet.  By the end of this essay, it will be possible to offer a critical evaluation of whether this is a realistic threat to humanity. 

### 02-Definitions:

- Data surveillance: Includes overt direct collection, covert direct collection and covert indirect collection to take information from consumers whenever they are on the internet. Overt is data we willingly give a corporation we are interacting with. Covert is when we are directly interacting and they use cookies to take extra information. Covert indirect is when we’re on a completely different site and they use cookies to track us and share these with a third party.

- Digital identities: The sum of all the digitally available information about us. Including information such as, name, date of birth, address, email address and online habits. [ref](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1337889) 

- Existential threat: In this context ‘An existential risk is one that threatens the premature extinction of Earth-originating intelligent life or the premature and drastic destruction of its potential desirable future development.’  In this instance we will be looking at how manipulation of online data can be used to ‘tame’ human beings and how this is a drastic destruction of humanities potential.


### 03-The Growth of Digital Identities
One good way of illustrating our digital identity is by using a Visitor and Resident Map (V&R Map). This is a process designed by David White in order to explore an individual’s engagement with the web.  The below image is a V&R map of my own engagement with the web. In the context of my research question, the main take away I had from analysing this map was how the majority of websites on there asks for my data in order to access it. This includes websites where you are only a visitor, so not knowingly leaving any trace of being there. While I do not post anything on Facebook or interact with any communities, cookies are being used to monitor what I am looking at on there, who I am friends with and what posts I like, allowing them to build up a picture of me as an individual. It also includes institutional websites that you are required to use for work, meaning if you are not willing to give away your data you are not able to work. For me these are websites such as Talis and Jstor, both of which I am reliant on to find research for my university work, such as this paper. If I did not have access to these sites, I would be closing off my access to millions of documents that I could use for my degree. Almost every job has specific websites it needs to access in order to complete their work, even most manual labour jobs are required to log in to a payroll website and to sign in to work through a thumb print scanner. This means unless they are willing to allow cookies to collect their data, they will not be able to work.

As discussed, in recent years use of the internet comes at the price of personal data. It is impossible to visit a modern website without agreeing to share your data with not just the site you are visiting but also third parties. Personal identifiable information (PII) uses data to confirm an individual’s identity and can be used to track individuals’ habits across multiple websites. The way this works is by using cookies. Cookies are pieces of data that websites can store on an individual’s computer to remember information about them. Most modern websites rely on cookies to provide their service. For example, in order for Amazon to remember what you have placed in your shopping basket it needs to use cookies. However, this use of cookies has developed over time to collect more and more information on internet users. These cookies are invisible and can develope a profile on a person without them having any knowledge about it, collecting data such as what they have liked on Facebook or interacted with on Twitter.  By doing this corporations are able to build an image of individuals as consumers, tracking their habits to predict what they will do next. “PII is the currency users use to gain access to a website”.  This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, companies having information about your individual habits is justified through personal suggestions as to what you want to see when you are online, such as personalised ads. This leads to a curated experience online, arguably giving the consumer the best possible experience on the web.
Where this becomes dangerous is the development of what Zuboff calls ‘Surveillance Capitalism’, which takes this data and applies it in a way which does not have the individual’s best interest in mind. Data is the new oil. It is a raw material which can be used by powerful actors to create guaranteed revenue streams. Once these actors have collected enough data to categorise internet users, they able to target them in such a way they can guarantee the result they are aiming for. “Nearly every product or service that begins with the word “smart” or “personalised”, every internet-enabled device, every “digital assistant”, is simply a supply-chain interface for the unobstructed flow of behavioural data on its way to predicting our futures in a surveillance economy.”
